         As part of an Android App I am building a button set. The buttons are part of a nested set of LinearLayouts. Using weight I have the set resizing itself automatically based on the size of the containing parent LinearLayout. The idea is, based on the pixel count and density of the screen, to set the size of the containing layout to a number of pixels; and have the button set resize itself based on that change.

The question then is: How to resize the layout.

I have tried several suggested techniques, and none come close to working. Here is a subset of the XML that builds the button set:
